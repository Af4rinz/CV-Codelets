# CV-Codelets
A series of various image processing algorithms for Fundamentals of Computer Vision course (Fall 2021).

All input images are taken from image processing test collections and *Digital Image Processing* by R.C. Gonzales and R.E. Woods.

## Implemented Algorithms
- Affine transformation with bilinear and nearest neighbour interpolation options
- 2-dimensional convolution-based filtering in spatial domain for single and multi band imaged (greyscale, rgb, rgba, etc)
- Fast box filter using dynamic programming (on single and multi band)
- Robert edge detection filters
- Global histogram equalisation 
- Fast local histogram localisation using bilinear interpolation
- Unsharp masking for greyscale images using box, weighted avergae, and median filters.
- High-pass and low-pass filtering with FFT.
- Copy-move forgery detection with wavelet transform.
- Image similarity measure with wavelet transform.
- Noise reduction with wavelet transform.
