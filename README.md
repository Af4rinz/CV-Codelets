# CV-Codelets
A series of various image processing algorithms for Fundamentals of Computer Vision course (Fall 2021)
All input images are taken from image processing test collections. 

## Implemented Algorithms
- Affine transformation with bilinear and nearest neighbour interpolation options
- 2-dimensional convolution-based filtering in spatial domain for single and multi band imaged (greyscale, rgb, rgba, etc)
- Fast box filter using dynamic programming (on single and multi band)
- Robert edge detection filters
- Global histogram equalisation 
- Fast local histogram localisation using bilinear interpolation
- Unsharp masking for greyscale images using box, weighted avergae, and median filters.
